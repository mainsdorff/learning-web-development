          <p>The desire to be respected by someone of the opposite sex is something that runs deep within everyone, even though most
          people don't take the time to find someone who truly respects them. It seems like people are just looking for someone to
          show them the slightest amount of attention, settling for something much less than respect. I am convinced one of the
          best ways to help any relationship grow is by showing respect.</p>
          <p>I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be
          respected. What is respect? Respect is showing someone extra special attention, or high regard, based on a desire to
          show them how highly they are valued.</p>
